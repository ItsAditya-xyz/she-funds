## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration 
The discovery of women-led businesses and opportunities has always been a challenge especially 
when it comes to funding and matching with the right investors. We created a crypto crowdfunding 
platform that focuses on women-led or women empowerment businesses.

## âš™ What it does
Pitch ideas, Raise Funds, and bring your creative ideas to life by building in public.

## ðŸ›  How we built it
- For building Frontend, we use React JS and TailwindCss
- Used Flask as a backend to store all the content and updated it in real-time.
- Used different libraries like DesoPy, DesoJS
- Blockchain we use for decentralization is Deso

## ðŸ’ª Challenges we ran into
- It is my first time building a decentralized Dapp on Deso. At first, we planned to add some great features like submitting the idea 
we got a notification on Whatsapp using Twilio, But we are unable to do so due to lack of time.
- We had a difficult time implementing the text overlay on the image as well, and it was hard to make a fully responsive UI.

## ðŸ“Œ Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Well, we built a whole social platform in 16 hours!! That's the biggest achievement of this hackathon.
- Able to build the app on Deso that really solves the issue.
- Ourself for trying our best.

## ðŸ“š What we learned
- Learned more about Deso. Learned a lot more about Tailwind CSS and responsive designs.
- What's next for SheFunds
- Scaling to hundreds of thousands of users and UX improvements!
- Making the code Open Source and engaging different People.
